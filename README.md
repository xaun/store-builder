## Store Builder
StoreBuilder, is a tool that allows you to build & manage your own online store.

Add & edit products, manage orders, add staff members, and send your store live into a responsive single-page application that saves cart items & guest information to Local Storage.

StoreBuilder is my final project that I did for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.

The idea behind this project choice was not to make an app that's particularly needed in the world, but more to do something that had lots of models, associations and also used BackboneJS to send the store live into a single-page app style.

You can check-out items, see the orders show up in the admin tool of the respective store. Payment processing is not integrated at this point - everything is free!

## Toolkit
This application uses Ruby on Rails, BackboneJS written in CoffeeScript, Bootstrap, HTML5 LocalStorage, Haml & Sass.

## Special Thanks
And another massive thanks to Joel Turnbull & Daniel Tsui for their help throughout this project & the entire course.
